\section*{Regula-Falsi Method}

Regula-Falsi method or the method of false position is a numerical method for estimating roots of a polynomial. It is a combination of the secant method and bisection methods.

The idea is that if you have a smooth function that doesn’t change much, you can approximate the function with a line using two endpoints $[a, b]$. The endpoints are joined with a chord; The point where the chord crosses the x-axis is the new “guess” for the root. The appropriate endpoint is updated with the new guess, then the algorithm continues, honing in on the actual root.

The Regula-Falsi tends to be faster than the bisection method and requires fewer iterations, this comes with a higher computational cost. Compared to the secant method, it requires more iterations

Algorithm for the Regula–Falsi Method: Given a continuous function f(x)
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item Choose two initial guesses, $a$ and $b$, such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs.
     \item Compute the point $c$ where the chord connecting $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$ intersects the x-axis. Now, the equation of the chord joining A[a, f(a)] and B[b, f(b)] is given by: $$c = \frac{a.f(b)-b.f(a)}{f(b)-f(a)} $$ 
     \item Compute the value of the function at $c$, $f(c)$.
     \item  Is $f(c) = 0$? If so, stop here. You’ve found the root. If not, continue to the next step.
     \item Replace a or b with c, depending on the sign of f(c) in that if:
     \begin{itemize} 
        \item $f(a). f(b) < 0$ then $b = c$
         \item $f(a). f(b) > 0$ then $a = c$
      \end{itemize}
       \item Continue the process repeatedly until you reach 0 or the desired accuracy.
  \end{enumerate}

 \section*{Sample Problem}
 Show that $f(x) = x^3 + 3x - 5$ has a root in $[1,2]$, and use the Regula-Falsi Method to determine an approximation to the root that is accurate to at least within $10^{-6}$
 
 Now, the information required to perform the Regula Falsi Method is as follows:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item $f(x) = x^3 + 3x - 5$,
    \item Lower Guess a = 1,
    \item Upper Guess b = 2,
    \item And tolerance $e = 10^{-6}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution:} 
\begin{itemize}
   \item \emph{Iteration 1}
   
      $a=1$, $b=2$
      
      $f(1)= -1$ , $f(2)=9$
      
      $f(a).f(b) = -1 * 9 = -9 < 0$
      
      $c = \frac{a.f(b)-b.f(a)}{f(b)-f(a)} $ = $1.1$
      
      $f(a).f(c) = f(1).f(1.1) = 0.369 > 0$
      
      Since the above condition is not satisfied, we make c as our new lower  guess i.e. 
$a = c$,
$a = 1.1$
So, we have reduced the interval to :
$[1, 2] -> [1.1, 2]$

Now we check the loop condition i.e.

 fabs$(f(c)) > e$
$f(c) = f(1.1) = -0.369$
fabs$(f(c)) = 0.369 > e = 10^{-6}$
The loop condition is true so we will perform the next iteration.


\item \emph{Iteration 2}

$a = 1.1$, $b = 2$

$f(a)=f(1)=-5$,  $f(b)=f(2)=9$

$c = \frac{a.f(b)-b.f(a)}{f(b)-f(a)} $ = $1.135446686$

$f(a).f(c) = f(1).f(1.135446686) = -0.1297975921 < 0 $   

 Since the above condition is not satisfied, we make $c$ as our new lower guess i.e.
$a = c$,
$a = 1.135446686$

Again we have reduced the interval to :
$[1,2] -> [1.135446686,2]$  

Now we check the loop condition i.e.

 fabs$(f(c)) > e$
$f(c) = -0.1297975921$

fabs$(f(c)) = 0.1297975921 > e = 10^{-6} $
The loop condition is true so we will perform the next iteration.

As you can see, it converges to a solution which depends on the tolerance and number of iteration the algorithm performs.

\section*{Limitations}
While Regula Falsi Method, like Bisection Method, is always convergent; meaning that it is always leading towards a specific limit and relatively simple to understand,  there are also some drawbacks when this algorithm is used. As both Regula-Falsi and Bisection method are similar, there are some common limitaions both the algorithms have i.e. :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Rate of convergence:} 
The convergence of the regula falsi method can be very slow in some cases(May converge slowly for functions with big curvatures) as explained above.
\item \textbf{Relies on sign changes:} If a function $f (x)$ is such that it just touches the x -axis for example say $f(x) = 2$ then it will not be able to find lower guess $(a)$ such that $f(a)*f(b) < 0$
\item \textbf{Cannot detect Multiple Roots:}Like Bisection method, Regula Falsi Method fails to identify multiple different roots, which makes it less desirable to use compared to other methods that can identify multiple roots.
\end{itemize}
